                <ul>
                    <li><b>Early Life</b> - Udit Narayan Jha was born on 1 December 1955 in an ethnic Maithil Brahmin
                        family to Harekrishna Jha, a Nepalese national, and Bhuvaneshwari Jha, an Indian national</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Personal life</b> - In 2006, Ranjana Narayan claimed to be the Narayan's first wife, but
                        Narayan consistently denied it. Later, he accepted her as his wife and promised to provide for
                        her maintenance.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Carrer</b> - Narayan is one of the most prominent singers of Bollywood throughout the 1990s
                        and early 2000s. He has been the on-screen singing voice for various Bollywood stars. He has
                        sung for Bollywood actors Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, Dev Anand, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh
                        Khan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn. Most of his duets are with Alka Yagnik. He began
                        his career in 1970 as a Maithili folk singer (staff artist) for Radio Nepal, singing mostly
                        popular folk songs in Maithili and Nepali</li><br>
                    <li><b>Other work</b> - Narayan's friend Jiyand Nawab Deedag suggested he change his work from old
                        to modern in order to be selected as a playback singer, but this did not work and, considering
                        old films in 1973, Narayan sang a song for a Nepali film called Sindoor. This was a comedy song
                        for the Nepali comedians GopalRaj Mainali (Chankhe) and Basundhara Bhushal (Nakkali). Narayan
                        sang this song with Sushma Shrestha, now known as Poornima in Hindi films. Narayan has also
                        acted in two Nepali films â€“ Kusume Rumal[35] and Pirati in 1985. </li><br>
